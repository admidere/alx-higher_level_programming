Reading and Writing Files

open() returns a file object, and is most commonly used with two positional arguments and one keyword argument: 
open(filename, mode, encoding=None)

f = open('workfile', 'w', encoding="utf-8")

with statement in Python

with statement is used in exception handling to make the code cleaner and much more readable. 
It simplifies the management of common resources like file streams. 

f.readline() reads a single line from the file; a newline character (\n) is left at the end of the string, 
and is only omitted on the last line of the file if the file doesn’t end in a newline.
This makes the return value unambiguous; if f.readline() returns an empty string, the end of the file has been reached, 
while a blank line is represented by '\n', a string containing only a single newline.sss

f.tell() returns an integer giving the file object’s current position in the file represented 
as number of bytes from the beginning of the file when in binary mode and an opaque number when in text mode.

To change the file object’s position, use f.seek(offset, whence). The position is computed from adding offset to a reference point; 
the reference point is selected by the whence argument. A whence value of 0 measures from the beginning of the file, 
1 uses the current file position, and 2 uses the end of the file as the reference point. whence can be omitted and defaults to 0,
 using the beginning of the file as the reference point

 Saving structured data with json

 The JSON format is commonly used by modern applications to allow for data exchange.
  Many programmers are already familiar with it, which makes it a good choice for interoperability.

   JSON files must be encoded in UTF-8. Use encoding="utf-8" when opening JSON file as a text file for both of reading and writing.
   json.dump(obj, fp, *, skipkeys=False, ensure_ascii=True, check_circular=True, allow_nan=True, cls=None, 
   indent=None, separators=None, default=None, sort_keys=False, **kw)

   Syntax: 
   json.dumps(obj, *, skipkeys=False, ensure_ascii=True, check_circular=True, allow_nan=True, cls=None, indent=None, separators=None, default=None, sort_keys=False, **kw)
